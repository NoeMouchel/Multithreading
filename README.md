## Instruction


<br>

To Enable multiThread and re-enable it, go in "Include/Core/MultiThread.hpp", then comment / uncomment the macro MULTITHREAD_ENABLED.

To see the scene loading directly, I advise you to go in edit mode and try loading *Sponza* (This scene is an obj alone so the scene is initialized before the load end while for the other scene that have lot of gameobjects the scene is initialized short before the end of the load)

<br>

When in EDITOR mode, 'WASD' to move and 'Q' and 'E' to decrease / increase camera speed.

<br>

## How does the ThreadPool work ?

<br>

The threadpool contains a queue which stock functions waiting to be executed, and a list of thread.

<br>

The thread stocked in the list are looping and checking the queue to execute the function stocked one per one without causing data races.

<br>

Each thread can execute one function from the queue at a time.

The queue is safely filled by the function **addInQueue**.

<br>

An atomic boolean value called "done" control the end of the multithread and when it is set to true, all the thread will be joined in the function **stop** so we can close the program safely.
